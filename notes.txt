Notes to improve coding

1. hov -> is_horizontal
2. learn how to use data structures better
   remove boilerplate code and make use of std functions
   understand std::string
3. Make use of information you already have
   don't create names again when you already stored them
4. Don't use parallel data structures, that is, multiple data structures that contain related information
5. Don't duplicate information
6. Be consistent with naming
7. Don't use magic numbers
