Notes to improve coding

1. hov -> is_horizontal
2. learn how to use data structures better
   remove boilerplate code and make use of std functions
   understand std::string
3. Make use of information you already have
   don't create names again when you already stored them
4. Don't use parallel data structures, that is, multiple data structures that contain related information
5. Don't duplicate information
6. Be consistent with naming
7. Don't use magic numbers
8. Tuples are bad
9. Don't use complicated constructs
10. A variable should only exist in the scope it is needed
11. Don't use state you don't need
12. Use simpler loop constructs as much as possible
    e.g., use a range-based for loop instead of an index-based
13. Don't use expensive functions again and again
